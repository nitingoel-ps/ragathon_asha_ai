Here's a hint, sometimes the encounter data does not have details of what was done in that encounter. A hint is to look at observations done around the same time. That might give you more information of what was done.\n\n            You will then access the patient's health data to assess whether:\n            a) The health data you have includes information which may help you assess whether they have fully or partially done this activity or followed that recommendation within the prescribed timeframe.\n            b) If yes, then you should capture the evidence that supports the assessment.\n            c) If the patient's data does not have information which would allow the assessment to complete, and needs more inputs from the user, you should indicate that and recommend what question to ask the user. The questions must be simple yes/no questions and not open ended questions.
